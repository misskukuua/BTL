Problem Statement

Many abused and vulnerable children in rural areas face significant challenges in accessing mental health support and overcoming the emotional scars of their experiences. The lack of resources, limited awareness, and limited availability of specialized services hinder their path to recovery and emotional well-being. Traditional therapeutic approaches often fail to provide a safe and non-threatening environment for these children to express themselves and develop essential coping strategies
